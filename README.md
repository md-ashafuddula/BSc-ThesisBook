This is my whole thesis book written in latex. All credit goes to **Minhazul Haque vai 10 series**.
I could not complete this without his templet.

I have included some new packages and modify some required portion as per my work.
If anyone wants to use this as a template clone this into your desktop then at first run this in your machine with textmaker/textstudio or any latex editor.
I used textstudio.

Remember, when you try to run this code for the first time in your machine try to put Internet connection in on-state so that the required packages can get installed autometically.
