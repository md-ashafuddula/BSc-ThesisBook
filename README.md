This is my whole thesis book written in latex. All credit goes to **Minhazul Haque vai 10 series**.
I could not complete this without his ``Template``.

I have included some new packages and modified some required portions as per my work.
If anyone wants to use this as a template I would request you to clone this on your desktop and then run this on your machine with text-maker/text-studio or any latex editor.
I used text-studio.

Remember, when you try to run this code for the first time on your machine try to put an Internet connection in ``on-state`` so that the required packages can get installed automatically 
or you can use ``OverLeaf`` that automatically installs the required libraries for it.
